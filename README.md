# Cloudfront Auth

[Google Apps (G Suite)](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect), [Microsoft Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-protocols-oauth-code), [GitHub](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorization-options-for-oauth-apps/), [OKTA](https://www.okta.com/), [Auth0](https://auth0.com/), [Centrify](https://centrify.com) authentication for [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) using [Lambda@Edge](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-edge.html). The original use case for `cloudfront-auth` was to serve private S3 content over HTTPS without running a proxy server in EC2 to authenticate requests; but `cloudfront-auth` can be used authenticate requests of any Cloudfront origin configuration.

## Description

Upon successful authentication, a cookie (named `TOKEN`) with the value of a signed JWT is set and the user redirected back to the originally requested path. Upon each request, Lambda@Edge checks the JWT for validity (signature, expiration date, audience and matching hosted domain) and will redirect the user to configured provider's login when their session has timed out.

## Usage

If your CloudFront distribution is pointed at a S3 bucket, [configure origin access identity](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.html#private-content-creating-oai-console) so S3 objects can be stored with private permissions. (Origin access identity requires the S3 ACL owner be the account owner. Use our [s3-object-owner-monitor](https://github.com/Widen/s3-object-owner-monitor) Lambda function if writing objects across multiple accounts.)

Enable SSL/HTTPS on your CloudFront distribution; AWS Certificate Manager can be used to provision a no-cost certificate.

Session duration is defined as the number of hours that the JWT is valid for. After session expiration, cloudfront-auth will redirect the user to the configured provider to re-authenticate. RSA keys are used to sign and validate the JWT.

## Lambda Deployment Packages

### Custom Packages

A custom package has all the configuration baked into it (including secrets). To build a custom package, execute:

```bash
./build.sh
```

The build script prompts you for the required configuration parameters, which are described in [Identity Provider Guides](#identity-provider-guides). If the files `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub` do not exist they will be automatically generated by the build. To disable all issued JWTs upload a new ZIP using the Lambda Console after deleting the `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub` files (a new key will be automatically generated).

### Generic Packages

A generic package retrieves its configuration at runtime from the [AWS Systems Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/) Parameter Store and [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/). Currently, support for this type of package has been added for OKTA Native only. To disable all issued JWTs, rotate the key pair using the Secrets Manager console.

Generic packages are available for download from the Releases page of this GitHub repository. Or, to build a generic package yourself, execute:

```bash
./build.sh package
```

The supported values of `package` are:

* `okta_native` - builds a generic Lambda package for OKTA Native authentication
* `rotate_key_pair` - builds a Lambda package for rotating the RSA keys in AWS Secrets Manager

## Configure Lambda and CloudFront

See [Manual Deployment](https://github.com/Widen/cloudfront-auth/wiki/Manual-Deployment) __*or*__ [AWS SAM Deployment](https://github.com/Widen/cloudfront-auth/wiki/AWS-SAM-Deployment)

If deploying a generic package, you also need to follow the steps below in the `us-east-1` region. In these steps, replace `{name}` with the name of the Lambda authentication function you created and `{account_id}` with the AWS Account ID number.

1. Modify the role on the Lambda authentication function to include a policy that:
    * allows the action `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` on resource `arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:{account_id}:secret:{name}/*`
    * allows the action `ssm:GetParametersByPath` on resource `arn:aws:ssm:us-east-1:{account_id}:parameter/{name}`
1. Execute `./build.sh rotate_key_pair`
1. Create a Lambda rotation function with the following configuration:
    * Function code: Use the `rotate_key_pair.zip` file found in the distributions folder
    * Runtime: **Node.js 10.x** or later
    * Handler: `index.handler`
    * Timeout: 30 sec
1. Modify the role on the Lambda rotation function to include a policy that:
    * allows the action `secretsmanager:PutSecretValue` on resource `arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:{account_id}:secret:{name}/*`
1. Create a secret in AWS Secrets Manager named `{name}/key-pair`
1. Enable secret rotation on the secret and associate it with the Lambda rotation function

## Authorization Method Examples

* [Use Google Groups to authorize users](https://github.com/Widen/cloudfront-auth/wiki/Google-Groups-Setup)

* JSON array of email addresses

    ```json
    [ "foo@gmail.com", "bar@gmail.com" ]
    ```

## Testing

Detailed instructions on testing your function can be found [in the Wiki](https://github.com/Widen/cloudfront-auth/wiki/Debug-&-Test).

## Build Requirements

* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) ^5.6.0
* [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) ^10.0
* [openssl](https://www.openssl.org)

## Contributing

All contributions are welcome. Please create an issue in order open up communication with the community.

When implementing a new flow or using an already implemented flow, be sure to follow the same style used in `build.js`. The config.json file should have an object for each request made. For example, `openid.index.js` converts config.AUTH_REQUEST and config.TOKEN_REQUEST to querystrings for simplified requests (after adding dynamic variables such as state or nonce). For implementations that are not generic (most), endpoints are hardcoded in to the config (or discovery documents).

Be considerate of our [limitations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cloudfront-limits.html#limits-lambda-at-edge). The zipped function can be no more than 1MB in size and execution cannot take longer than 5 seconds, so we must pay close attention to the size of our dependencies and complexity of operations.
